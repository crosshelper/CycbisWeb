              <p>I just bought a house in Orange County, didn’t know how to create accounts for all my utilities and start the services. Mr. Chen helped me called in and prepared the paperwork for all of them, even helped me paid my first month bills. He has been really helpful. I am so glad I found him when I had those problems. </p>

              <p>I came here for school in 2014 and never been to US before. To start my life here, I had to open a bank account and a phone line right away. I was referred by my roommate to Mr. Chen, who helped me with the bank and phone line within 1.5 hours. He made my life in US much easier, especially at the very beginning. </p>

              <p>I was totally lost in tons of the paperwork for new employees, having no idea of the 401K, paid vacations, tax and insurances. I found Mr. Chen, he explained all those terms for me in really comprehensive way with examples of real cases. I felt so prepared to sign all the documents and got my career started with full confidence in what I would be facing.</p>

              <p>I was traveling in Los Angeles last year, and parked my car on the street where it was not allowed. My rental car got towed and I didn’t know what should I do next. I found Mr. Chen and he guided me step by step to get my car back the same day! I can’t imagine what my trip would be without his help.</p>
